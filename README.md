# Implementation of Caesar Cipher Algorithm

The Caesar Cipher Algorithm is a substitution Cipher Algorithm where each letter in the plaintext that is the message is provided as the input by the user to encrypt and using the shift key based on which the shifting of the letters occurs in the plaintext and results in the Ciphertext.

The Ciphertext can later be decrypted to the plaintext with the same key or shift value.This ensures the safety and unauthorized access of the information to the malicious users.

Also designed a Graphical User Interface using Tkinter so that the user can input a message through the message box and select the mode whether to encrypt or decrypt by providing a shift or key value.

The glimpses of the GUI designed as attached below:
